In 2 years at [tavisca](http://tavisca.com/), Pune (2018-2020), I played the role of the Head of Product Practice, where I focussed towards instilling a culture of excellence in Product design and development. tavisca (and its parent company [cxLoyalty](http://cxloyalty.com/default.aspx)) is in the business of Customer Loyalty & Engagement, with a focus towards Platform-as-a-Product for the Travel domain.

I have been with [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com) for 7+ years. At ThoughtWorks, as a software craftsman and technical consultant I helped teams and organisations apply principles of Continuous Delivery and Extreme Programming (XP) to solve problems and delight customers.

Earlier, I was also the Product Manager & Community Lead for [Bahmni](http://www.bahmni.org) - an Open Source Hospital Management system created by ThoughtWorks. In this role, I worked towards helping shape the roadmap for Bahmni and evangelising Open Source software for humanitarian purposes.

Within ThoughtWorks I have worked on large-scale Web projects in Travel, Health, Retail and Consumer Electronics domains. I am passionate about product development, tech writing, teaching and using technology for social good.

Some folks say that I do have a rather curious knack to make connections between the programming world and the one we physically inhabit. I think they might be right.
