Driving in India is a test of patience. And a waste of time.

A few months ago, I decided to try an experiment while driving to office, about a 30 minute ride each way.
The experiment was: Podcasts.

Turns out, I had uncovered something amazing. Podcasts made me forget the time I spend on the road, and instead opened a window to a world I didn't know existed.
I now found an opportunity to hear interviews and stories, of lives of people, in far away places.
People, whose stories, I would otherwise never have heard.


Here is a list of podcasts I really enjoyed, or were super thought-provoking. If you like these, please bookmark this post. I will constantly update this as I come across more interesting podcasts.
