For years, automobile companies have utilized "Mistake Proofing" as a technique for ensuring high quality,
high speed manufacturing -- especially in cases of mass scale production.
This is also known as Poka-Yoke (in Japanese) and was adopted and formalized as part of the Toyota Production System.
This blog attempts to raise awareness (with examples) for the need of Poka Yoke in Software Design and
within the Software Development process.
