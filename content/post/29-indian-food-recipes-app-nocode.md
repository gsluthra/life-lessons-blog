### Food Recipes App - NoCode

My brother (Simarpreet), who is a home-chef, wanted to create a mobile app with Indian food recipes (mostly as made in Punjabi homes). The idea being that one has an app in their pocket that can be pulled out while doing grocery shopping, or standing in the kitchen, to quickly see simple home made recipes & ingredients. 

I didn't want to spend time coding an app. So, decided to use [GlideApps](https://www.glideapps.com/), to design & build this, with nocode! GlideApps lets you create a PWA (Progressive Web App) within the browser, and uses a Google Sheet as the backing database to pull data for the mobile app. 

So, in essence, I created a Google Sheet, in which my brother wrote recipes over a period of 3+ months -- and I designed the app in GlideApps Browser UI. The app took me only a weekend to design. 

The outcome is pretty great! I am impressed how one can create "informational" apps so easily with GlideApps. And it does support two way data sync -- like sending Likes, etc back to the Sheet whenever someone interacts with the app. Pretty cool!

### Install the App

Do check out the app with yummy biryani, chicken, pulao, rajma, chole, chutney, etc. recipes here: [Indian-Recipes 100+ free - http://indian-recipes.glideapp.io/](http://indian-recipes.glideapp.io/). It does not need to be downloaded. Just select "*Share --> Add to Home Screen*". Simple!
