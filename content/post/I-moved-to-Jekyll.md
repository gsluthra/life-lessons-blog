My blog on Google Blogspot [techie-notebook.blogspot.com](http://techie-notebook.blogspot.com) hit the 100,000 views mark. I am super excited. But, I didn't really like the way my blog looked. I wanted it to be simple. I wanted it to be
elegant. I wanted to render code, like it should. I wanted the programmer in me, to be in control. So I moved to
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Moving forward, I will write my lessons, and thoughts here; and [life-lessons.in](http://life-lessons.in) will its home.
I hope my blog readers will appreciate the move.

**UPDATE [Jun-2021]:** *I moved now to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) based blog, from Jekyll. I had to do this because everytime I changed my laptop, the Jekyll ruby & gem versions would get upgraded and become incompatible with my existing setup. The pain of fixing it everytime didn't feel worth it.*
