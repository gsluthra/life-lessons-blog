### Mushtaq Ahmed: From Doctor to Coding Architect - Episode #5
In this episode on [_Expertease_](https://anchor.fm/expertease), we have an honest and insightful conversation with a dear friend and colleague [Mushtaq Ahmed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mushtaq-ahmed-a0b76b/?originalSubdomain=in), Principal Consultant at Thoughtworks Pune.
We cover topics ranging from his interests, his journey from studying to be a Doctor, then becoming a BA, then a Developer and now a Senior Technical Leader; 
and his passion for programming. He is a Scala evangelist. In the later part of the podcast we discuss his work with Thirty Meter Telescope and architecture principles for building systems at Astronomical scale.
